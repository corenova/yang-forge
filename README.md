# yang-forge 

YANG package manager and runtime engine

`yfc` is the command utility providing YANG model-driven application
lifecycle management.

It provides advanced abstractions on top of
[yang-cc](http://github.com/corenova/yang-cc) for richer schema
interactions and flexible runtime capabilities such as dynamic
interface generation (cli, express, restjson, websockets).

This module is a special core generated using the
[yang-cc](http://github.com/corenova/yang-cc) application core
composition library based on
[yang-forge-core.yang](yang-forge-core.yang) schema.

This software is brought to you by
[Corenova](http://www.corenova.com).  We'd love to hear your feedback.
Please feel free to reach me at <peter@corenova.com> anytime with
questions, suggestions, etc.

It is written primarily using [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org)
and runs on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and the **web browser**.

## Installation
```bash
$ npm install -g yang-forge
```
You must have `node >= 0.10.28` as a minimum requirement to run
`yang-forge`.

## Usage
```
  Usage: yfc [options] [command]


  Commands:

    schema [options] [file]     process a specific YANG schema file or string
    build [options] [file...]   package the module(s) for deployment/publishing
    inspect [options] [core]    inspect a given core package file to extract metadata
    run [options] [module...]   runs one or more core(s) and module(s)
    deploy                      deploy core(s) into target endpoint (planned)
    info [options] [core]       shows info about a published core from the registry (planned)
    search [keyword...]         search the registry for cores matching keywords (planned)
    publish [options]           publish package to upstream registry (planned)
    translate [options] [file]  translates input configuration data according to available YANG schema(s) (planned)

  This module provides YANG package management and runtime engine operations

  Options:

    -h, --help     output usage information
    -V, --version  output the version number
    -v, --verbose  increase verbosity
    --no-color     disable color output
```

The `yfc` command-line interface is **runtime-generated** according to
[yang-forge-core.yang](yang-forge-core.yang) schema definitions.
Please refer to the schema section covering various `rpc` extension
statements and sub-statement definitions for a reference regarding
different types of command-line arguments, descriptions, and options
processing syntax.  The corresponding **actions** for each of the
`rpc` extensions are *dynamically linked* by the `yang-cc` composer by
inspecting the `lib` directory in the package.

For comprehensive **usage documentation** around various CLI commands,
please refer to the [YangForge Examples README](examples#readme).

## Troubleshooting

When you encounter errors or issues while utilizing the `yfc` command
line utility, you can set ENVIRONMENTAL variable `yang_debug=1` to get
complete debug output of the execution log.

```bash
$ yang_debug=1 yfc <some-command>
```

The output generated is very verbose and may or may not assist you in
determining the root cause. However, when reporting an issue into the
Github repository, it will be helpful to paste a snippet of the debug
output for quicker resolution by the project maintainer.

## Available YANG features

name | description | dependency
--- | --- | ---
[cli](src/yang-forge-core/feature/cli.coffee) | generates command-line interface | none
[express](src/yang-forge-core/feature/express.coffee) | generates HTTP/HTTPS web server instance | none
[restjson](src/yang-forge-core/feature/restjson.coffee) | generates REST/JSON web services interface | express
[websocket](src/yang-forge-core/feature/websocket.coffee) | generates socket.io interface | express

You can click on the *name* entry above for reference documentation on
each feature module.

## API

Here's an example for using this module:

```coffeescript
yf = require 'yang-forge'
yf.run 'express', 5050 # fire up express instance on port 5050
yf.run 'restjson'      # bind restjson interface generator to express
yf.run 'websocket'     # bind socket.io to express
```
Since [YangForge](src/index.coffee) itself is a YANG schema
([yang-forge-core.yang](./yang-forge-core.yang)) **compiled** module,
it is simply the `Core` object instance generated by the
[yang-cc](http://github.com/corenova/yang-cc) module.

You can also interact with the **yang-forge-core** module instance
directly to *invoke* the various RPC methods available.

```coffeescript
yf = require 'yang-forge'
forge = yf.access 'yang-forge-core' # grab the yang-forge-core module
forge.invoke 'build', arguments: [ 'foo.yang', 'bar.yang' ]
.then (res) ->
  console.log res.get()
```

The above example will generate a new `composition` output similarly
to what `yang-cc` produced.  For more info on other RPC methods
available, take a look at the
[yang-forge-core.yang](./yang-forge-core.yang) schema.

## Major changes from prior 0.11.x branch

Please note that the newly designed `YangForge` no longer contains
native interfaces to **compiler** methods such as
parse/load/compile/etc. In order to access previous capabilities, you
can consider utilizing the **rpc schema** interface via the *invoke*
mechanism or just use the underlying
[yang-js](https://github.com/saintkepha/yang-js) or
[yang-cc](https://github.com/corenova/yang-cc) modules directly.

This design change is a result of modularizing the earlier `YangForge`
project into three distinct components:

name | description
--- | ---
[yang-js](https://github.com/saintkepha/yang-js) | YANG parser and compiler
[yang-cc](https://github.com/corenova/yang-cc) | YANG model-driven application core composer
[yang-forge](https://github.com/corenova/yang-forge) | YANG package manager and runtime engine

Furthermore, previous YAML schema to represent a **forged** module
(with dependencies and behaviors) for a target YANG schema has been
*superceded* by the new `composition` and `specification` custom YANG
extensions.

Due to potential breaking changes and other considerations, the
previous `yangforge` package has been renamed to `yang-forge` and the
former package will be marked *deprecated* but preserved for the near
future.
